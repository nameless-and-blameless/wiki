# **The Law of Conscious Activities**
"A conscious entity committed to completing an activity will remain committed to completing it, retrying with increasing intensity, until acted upon by an equal or greater opposing force."

This law emphasizes the persistence and increasing effort of a conscious being towards a goal, and how this persistence can only be halted by a significant opposing force.
